## Recommendations

> Michael and I work together at Corvesta Inc. where he was a Senior Software Engineer. He jumped right
> in when he first came on board to help with efforts of converting our legacy system to a web platform using
> MVC, C# and Oracle. He is always goes above and beyond to learn new things and to help others learn as
> well. Mike pioneered the efforts on our weekly lunch and learn sessions, where were shared insights on new
> and existing technology. He was also on my Innovation Team where he spent his own personal time learning
> about new web technologies to help bring value to the team. He would bring value to any team he was on.

> For the past year, I have had the fortunate opportunity to work with Mike on the Army Mapper application
> at GISinc. Mike's professionalism, work ethic, strong communication skills, and ability to learn and apply

> It is an honor to write this letter of recommendation for Mr. Michael Haggerty. Mike started with SiteVision,
> Inc. in May of 2007 as a web application developer. Mike was the lead developer on some of our most
> complex applications. I always looked forward to seeing the progress he was making because he often
> surprised me with subtle design or technical details that added great benefit to the application. Mike is a quick
> study on new technologies and understanding how these technologies can enhance the user experience while
> at the same time understanding the budget and needs of a client. In addition to his technical skills, Mike is an
> excellent communicator. He often worked with me and the client from the concept phase of an application
> to final delivery. I have no problem letting him work directly with any of our clients. I would not hesitate to
> recommend Michael for any position he might aspire to. Mike's enthusiasm and work ethic will make him a
