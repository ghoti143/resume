> MVC, C# and Oracle. He is always goes above and beyond to learn new things and to help others learn as
> well. Mike pioneered the efforts on our weekly lunch and learn sessions, where were shared insights on new
> and existing technology. He was also on my Innovation Team where he spent his own personal time learning
> about new web technologies to help bring value to the team. He would bring value to any team he was on.
